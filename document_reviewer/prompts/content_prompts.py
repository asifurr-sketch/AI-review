    def get_solution_passability_prompt():
        """Check if solution is passable according to limits"""
        return """
You are an expert algorithm complexity analyst. Evaluate if the provided solution can pass within the given time and memory limits.

IMPORTANT: Be realistic and practical. Most competitive programming solutions are designed to pass, so only flag CLEAR violations, not marginal cases.

WHAT TO ANALYZE:

1. **Time Complexity Analysis:**
   - Extract the time complexity from the solution/metadata
   - Find the maximum input constraints from the problem statement
   - Calculate worst-case number of operations
   - Compare against the time limit (1 second ≈ 10^8 operations, 2 seconds ≈ 2×10^8 operations)
   - Allow reasonable constant factors (2-5x is acceptable)

2. **Memory Complexity Analysis:**
   - Extract the space complexity from the solution/metadata
   - Calculate worst-case memory usage based on constraints
   - Compare against the memory limit
   - Consider language-specific overheads realistically:
     * Python: 3-5x overhead for complex objects, but simple data types are much less
     * C++/C: Minimal overhead (1-1.5x)
     * Java: 2-3x overhead
   - **CRITICAL: Only flag if memory usage clearly exceeds 75% of limit with overhead**

3. **Key Factors to Check:**
   - Does the time complexity allow completion within time limit?
   - Does the space complexity fit within memory limit?
   - Are there catastrophic constant factors (100x+)?
   - Are there hidden exponential complexities?

MEMORY ESTIMATION GUIDELINES (Python):

**Small Data Structures (ALMOST ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE):**
- Output buffer storing t results where t ≤ 10^6: ~10-50 MB with overhead → PASS for 32MB+ if < 20MB estimated
- Single array of 10^5 integers: ~3-5 MB → PASS for any reasonable limit
- Hash map with 10^5 entries: ~10-15 MB → PASS for 32MB+ limits
- String buffer < 10^6 characters: ~5-10 MB → PASS for 32MB+ limits

**Realistic Calculations:**
- List of t=2×10^5 small strings (10-20 chars each):
  * Raw: 200K × 15 = 3 MB
  * Python overhead (strings + list): ~2-3x = 6-9 MB
  * Verdict for 32 MB limit: **PASS** (uses < 30% of limit)

- Array of n=10^5 integers:
  * Python list: ~28 bytes per int object
  * Total: 10^5 × 28 = 2.8 MB
  * Verdict for 32 MB limit: **PASS** (uses < 10% of limit)

**ONLY FLAG AS FAIL:**
- 2D array 10^4 × 10^4 for 32MB limit (100M elements × 28 bytes = 2.8 GB) → FAIL
- Storing all test case inputs when t=10^6 and each input is 10^5 elements → FAIL
- Exponential space like 2^n where n > 20 → FAIL
- Building string of length > 10^7 for 32MB limit → LIKELY FAIL

**DO NOT FLAG (THESE ARE ACCEPTABLE):**
- Output buffers with t ≤ 10^6 results
- Single work arrays of size ≤ 10^6
- Hash maps/sets with ≤ 10^6 entries for limits ≥ 64MB
- Small administrative overhead (counters, temp variables)
- Streaming/online solutions with O(1) or O(log n) space

VALIDATION STEPS:

1. Identify time complexity and maximum constraints
2. Calculate operations: ops = f(max_constraints)
3. **Time verdict**: FAIL only if ops > 5×10^8 for 1 second limit (be generous)
4. Identify space complexity and calculate memory
5. Apply conservative overhead multiplier (2-3x for Python, not 5x)
6. **Memory verdict**: FAIL only if estimated_memory > 0.75 × memory_limit
7. **Overall**: PASS if both time and memory are reasonable

EXAMPLE ANALYSIS:

Problem: t ≤ 2×10^5, each test case produces one integer result, Memory: 32 MB
Code: Stores all t results in list before printing

Memory Calculation:
- Results: 2×10^5 strings (avg 15 bytes each)
- Raw data: 3 MB
- Python overhead (string objects + list): 2.5x → 7.5 MB
- Total: ~7.5 MB
- Limit: 32 MB
- Usage: 7.5/32 = 23% → **PASS** ✅

PASS if: Solution uses < 75% of memory limit and < 5× time budget (be practical!)
FAIL if: Solution clearly exceeds limits (e.g., uses > 80% of memory, or 10× time budget)

You are an expert problem analysis specialist. 

TASK: Determine if this problem can have multiple valid solutions for the same input, which would make it unsuitable for direct file matching validation.

CRITICAL ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Single Valid Output**: For ANY given valid input, there must be exactly ONE correct output
2. **Deterministic Result**: The problem should not allow different valid answers for the same test case
3. **No Multiple Correct Formats**: Output format should be strictly defined with no acceptable variations

EXAMPLES OF PROBLEMS THAT FAIL THIS CHECK:
- "Print any valid permutation" (multiple correct answers exist)
- "Output any path from A to B" (multiple valid paths possible)
- "Print elements in any order" (different orderings are valid)
- "Find any solution that satisfies the constraints" (multiple solutions exist)
- Problems with floating-point outputs where precision tolerance matters
- Problems asking for "one possible arrangement" or "any valid configuration"

EXAMPLES OF PROBLEMS THAT PASS THIS CHECK:
- "Find the minimum number of operations" (single numerical answer)
- "Calculate the maximum profit" (single numerical answer)
- "Determine if it's possible (YES/NO)" (binary answer)
- "Print the lexicographically smallest sequence" (deterministic ordering)
- "Output the unique solution" (explicitly states uniqueness)

3. **Constraints**: Determine if constraints guarantee uniqueness
4. **Examples**: Verify if given examples have only one possible correct output
5. **Problem Type**: Identify if it's optimization (usually unique) vs. construction (often multiple solutions)

VALIDATION CRITERIA:

- If multiple correct outputs exist for the same input → FAIL  
- If output ordering is flexible ("in any order") → FAIL
- If the problem guarantees unique solution → PASS
- If it's asking for optimal value (min/max) → Usually PASS

You are an expert algorithm complexity analyst specializing in precise violation identification.

TASK: Verify that time complexity in metadata covers ALL approaches and uses properly introduced variables from anywhere in the document.

CRITICAL LOCATION REPORTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. NEVER use "CHAIN_XX" - use exact identifiers like "CHAIN_01", "CHAIN_03", etc.
2. NEVER use "THOUGHT_XX_YY" - use exact identifiers like "THOUGHT_02_01", "THOUGHT_04_03", etc.  
3. Always reference specific sections: "Metadata section", "Number of Approaches field", etc.
4. Quote exact text when showing violations
5. Provide specific line references when available

**REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **All Approaches Covered**: The metadata must list time complexity for EVERY approach discussed in the document (brute force, optimized, final solution, etc.)
2. **Sequential Format**: Must follow the format showing progression from inefficient to efficient approaches using either "->" or "→" arrows
3. **Count Consistency**: The number of complexity expressions must match the count specified in "Number of Approaches" field
4. **No Extra Text**: Must NOT contain any descriptive text, approach explanations, or space complexity mentions
5. **Variable-Based**: Time complexity should use variables that are properly introduced somewhere in the document (problem statement, reasoning chains, response section, etc.). Variables should not be completely unrelated, undefined, or incorrectly used without any context or introduction in the document.
6. **Correctness**: Each stated time complexity must be mathematically correct for its corresponding approach
7. **Complex Expressions**: Support complex mathematical expressions with multiple terms (e.g., "O(n²+qn²)", "O(n*m + k*log(n))")

**ACCEPTABLE VARIABLE USAGE:**

**ACCEPTABLE FORMATS:**
- Single approach: "O(N)"
- Two approaches: "O(N^2) -> O(N log N)" or "O(N²) → O(N log N)"

- Mixed variables: "O(n*m + k) → O(n*m) → O(n+m)"
- Logarithmic terms: "O(n²log(n)) → O(n log n) → O(n)"

VIOLATION REPORTING FORMAT:
- [EXACT LOCATION]: [Specific violation with quoted text] 
- [EXACT LOCATION]: [Missing approach or incorrect variable usage]

EXAMPLE GOOD REPORTING:
- Metadata section → Number of Approaches field: Uses variable "X" in "O(n*X)" but variable "X" is never introduced, defined, or explained anywhere in the entire document (problem statement, chains, thoughts, or response sections)
- Number of Approaches field: Claims "3 approaches" but only lists 2 complexities: "O(N²) → O(N)"
- CHAIN_04: Discusses O(N log N) approach but metadata missing this complexity in progression

EXAMPLE BAD REPORTING (NEVER DO THIS):
- CHAIN_XX: Variable problems found
- Metadata has some issues
- Multiple complexity errors detected

**VALIDATION STEPS:**
1. Count all approaches discussed in the document (brute force, intermediate, final, etc.)
2. Check the "Number of Approaches" field to get the expected count and complexity progression
3. Verify metadata lists time complexity for each approach in progression order
4. Confirm the count of complexity expressions matches the stated number of approaches
5. For each variable used in the complexity notation, verify it is introduced SOMEWHERE in the document (problem statement, chains, thoughts, response, or approach discussions) - only flag variables that are completely undefined and unintroduced throughout the entire document
6. Check if each complexity is mathematically correct for its corresponding approach
7. Ensure no extra descriptive text or space complexity mentions
