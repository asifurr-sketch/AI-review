  - Brute force (exponential/O(m^n))
  - Final DP (O(n·m))

• Approaches Without Complexity: Greedy approaches (Chain 04) and alternative methods (Chain 05) are discussed but without time complexity analysis.

• Missing O(n·m²) Analysis: Two instances of O(n·m²) complexity listed in metadata but no corresponding approaches with this complexity are analyzed in the document.

⏱️ Completed in 1.35 minutes (81.0 seconds)
----------------------------------------
Result: ❌ FAIL
🧹 Cleaning up failure details...

Issues Found:
• Problem statement references undefined parameter S: "you are allowed to incinerate (discard) up to S of your front cards" but S is never defined in input format, constraints section, or examples

• Example 2 contains impossible explanation: States "Card 1 fails on all bulkheads, card 5 fails on first four (10s) but succeeds on the last (5). Total opened = 1" but this contradicts mechanics where failed cards remain at front and block queue - card 5 would never get chance to be used if card 1 fails and stays at front

• Goal ambiguity: Undefined parameter S conflicts with stated goal of minimizing discards - creates confusion between having discard budget limit versus unlimited strategic discarding

• Mechanical contradiction: Solution approach assumes unlimited strategic discarding at each bulkhead, but undefined S suggests global discard limit

• Result should be 0 opens in Example 2, not 1, based on stated mechanics

Result: ❌ FAIL
🧹 Cleaning up failure details...

Issues Found:
• THOUGHT_02_02 - Example 2 Analysis: States "Without discards: card 1 fails all, card 5 fails on first four but succeeds on the last = 1 open" - INCORRECT. Card 1 (power 1) fails all 5 bulkheads and never succeeds, so it's never consumed. Card 5 never becomes the front card. Actual result: 0 opens without discards.

• THOUGHT_02_03 - Discards beneficial case: States "With 2 discards: discard cards 1,2, card 6 succeeds all three = 3 opens" - INCORRECT. After discarding cards 1 and 2, card 6 becomes front and succeeds bulkhead 1 (6 ≥ 5) and is consumed. No cards remain for bulkheads 2 and 3. Actual result: 1 open, not 3.

• THOUGHT_02_04 - No discards needed: States "Cards are in reverse order but all succeed = 3 opens with 0 discards" - INCORRECT. Card 1 (power 3) succeeds bulkhead 1 (threshold 1), consumed. Card 2 (power 2) succeeds bulkhead 2 (threshold 2), consumed. Card 3 (power 1) fails bulkhead 3 (threshold 3). Actual result: 2 opens, not 3.

• THOUGHT_02_07 - Repeated thresholds: States "Without discards: card 1 fails, card 6 succeeds first..." - INCORRECT. Card 1 (power 1) fails all bulkheads and never gets consumed. Card 6 never becomes the front card without discarding card 1. Actual result: 0 opens without discards.

• THOUGHT_02_08 - Careful discard timing: States optimal is "2 opens with 2 discards" - INCORRECT. Better strategy exists: Let card 1 succeed on bulkhead 2 (1 ≥ 1), then card 2 succeeds on bulkhead 4 (5 ≥ 1). Actual optimal: 2 opens with 0 discards.

• Fundamental error in Chain 2's explanations: Misunderstanding that failed cards block the queue. When a card fails, it remains at the front and prevents access to subsequent cards unless explicitly discarded.

🔄 Running 18. Sample Test Case Dry Run Validation
⏱️ Completed in 3.29 minutes (197.6 seconds)
----------------------------------------
Result: ❌ FAIL
🧹 Cleaning up failure details...

Issues Found:
• THOUGHT_02_02: Incorrectly states "Without discards: card 1 fails all, card 5 fails first 4 but succeeds last = 1 open" (should be 0 opens)

• "Another Example" section: Claims "Without discards: Card 1 fails all bulkheads, Card 5 fails first 4 but succeeds on last = 1 open" (should be 0 opens)

• "Example Execution" sections: Walkthroughs are confusing and don't accurately represent either the actual game flow or the DP computation process

• Example 2 dry run error: Document incorrectly calculates that 1 bulkhead can be opened without any discards, when the correct answer is 0 bulkheads

• Game flow misunderstanding: Since card 1 never gets consumed (fails all attempts with power 1 vs thresholds 10,10,10,10,5), card 5 never becomes the front card, resulting in 0 opens not 1 open

🔄 Running 28. Chain Test Case Analysis Validation
⏱️ Completed in 1.20 minutes (72.0 seconds)
----------------------------------------
Result: ❌ FAIL

Issues Found:
• CHAIN_02 violates requirements throughout all thoughts (THOUGHT_02_01 through THOUGHT_02_10)

• THOUGHT_02_01: States "The card succeeds, so we need 0 discards to achieve 1 open" without showing step-by-step execution

• THOUGHT_02_02: States "Without discards: fails first (2<3), succeeds second (2≥1) = 1 open" but doesn't provide detailed trace like "At bulkhead 1: card power 2 vs threshold 3 → fails, move to bulkhead 2 with same card..."

• THOUGHT_02_03: States "Without discards: card 1 fails first, card 2 fails second, card 6 succeeds third = 1 open" but should have shown detailed steps like:
  - Step 1: At bulkhead 1 (threshold 5), front card is 1 (power 1). Compare: 1 < 5, fails. Move to bulkhead 2, card stays at position 0.
  - Step 2: At bulkhead 2 (threshold 3), front card is still 1 (power 1). Compare: 1 < 3, fails. Move to bulkhead 3, card stays at position 0.

• THOUGHT_02_04 through THOUGHT_02_10: All follow same pattern - propose test cases and state expected results but never walk through execution in detail

• CHAIN_02 only suggests test cases and states their expected outcomes

• CHAIN_02 does NOT provide step-by-step execution traces

• CHAIN_02 does NOT show detailed walkthroughs of how the algorithm processes each test case

• CHAIN_02 does NOT demonstrate the actual mechanics of the algorithm on specific inputs

• Entire chain is about designing test cases rather than analyzing them with detailed execution

📝 14. PROBLEM STATEMENT CONSISTENCY
--------------------------------------------------
Status: ❌ FAIL

Issues Found:
• Problem statement references undefined parameter S: "you are allowed to incinerate (discard) up to S of your front cards" but S is never defined in input format, constraints section, or examples

• Example 2 contains impossible explanation: States "Card 1 fails on all bulkheads, card 5 fails on first four (10s) but succeeds on the last (5). Total opened = 1" but this contradicts mechanics where failed cards remain at front and block queue - card 5 would never get chance to be used if card 1 fails and stays at front

• Goal ambiguity: Undefined parameter S conflicts with stated goal of minimizing discards - creates confusion between having discard budget limit versus unlimited strategic discarding

• Mechanical contradiction: Solution approach assumes unlimited strategic discarding at each bulkhead, but undefined S suggests global discard limit

• Result should be 0 opens in Example 2, not 1, based on stated mechanics

📝 17. TEST CASE VALIDATION
--------------------------------------------------
Status: ❌ FAIL

Issues Found:
• THOUGHT_02_02 - Example 2 Analysis: States "Without discards: card 1 fails all, card 5 fails on first four but succeeds on the last = 1 open" - INCORRECT. Card 1 (power 1) fails all 5 bulkheads and never succeeds, so it's never consumed. Card 5 never becomes the front card. Actual result: 0 opens without discards.

• THOUGHT_02_03 - Discards beneficial case: States "With 2 discards: discard cards 1,2, card 6 succeeds all three = 3 opens" - INCORRECT. After discarding cards 1 and 2, card 6 becomes front and succeeds bulkhead 1 (6 ≥ 5) and is consumed. No cards remain for bulkheads 2 and 3. Actual result: 1 open, not 3.

• THOUGHT_02_04 - No discards needed: States "Cards are in reverse order but all succeed = 3 opens with 0 discards" - INCORRECT. Card 1 (power 3) succeeds bulkhead 1 (threshold 1), consumed. Card 2 (power 2) succeeds bulkhead 2 (threshold 2), consumed. Card 3 (power 1) fails bulkhead 3 (threshold 3). Actual result: 2 opens, not 3.

• THOUGHT_02_07 - Repeated thresholds: States "Without discards: card 1 fails, card 6 succeeds first..." - INCORRECT. Card 1 (power 1) fails all bulkheads and never gets consumed. Card 6 never becomes the front card without discarding card 1. Actual result: 0 opens without discards.

• THOUGHT_02_08 - Careful discard timing: States optimal is "2 opens with 2 discards" - INCORRECT. Better strategy exists: Let card 1 succeed on bulkhead 2 (1 ≥ 1), then card 2 succeeds on bulkhead 4 (5 ≥ 1). Actual optimal: 2 opens with 0 discards.

• Fundamental error in Chain 2's explanations: Misunderstanding that failed cards block the queue. When a card fails, it remains at the front and prevents access to subsequent cards unless explicitly discarded.

--------------------------------------------------

📝 18. SAMPLE TEST CASE DRY RUN VALIDATION
--------------------------------------------------
Status: ❌ FAIL

Issues Found:
• THOUGHT_02_02: Incorrectly states "Without discards: card 1 fails all, card 5 fails first 4 but succeeds last = 1 open" (should be 0 opens)

• "Another Example" section: Claims "Without discards: Card 1 fails all bulkheads, Card 5 fails first 4 but succeeds on last = 1 open" (should be 0 opens)

• "Example Execution" sections: Walkthroughs are confusing and don't accurately represent either the actual game flow or the DP computation process

• Example 2 dry run error: Document incorrectly calculates that 1 bulkhead can be opened without any discards, when the correct answer is 0 bulkheads

• Game flow misunderstanding: Since card 1 never gets consumed (fails all attempts with power 1 vs thresholds 10,10,10,10,5), card 5 never becomes the front card, resulting in 0 opens not 1 open

• Missing relevant subtopic: "Functions and Recursion"
  - Chain 03 extensively discusses "direct recursive enumeration" as an approach
  - The DP solution is described as having a "recursive structure with overlapping subproblems"

  - Predicts the outcome that all paths lead to DP

--------------------------------------------------

📝 28. CHAIN TEST CASE ANALYSIS VALIDATION
--------------------------------------------------
Status: ❌ FAIL

Issues Found:
• CHAIN_02 violates requirements throughout all thoughts (THOUGHT_02_01 through THOUGHT_02_10)

• THOUGHT_02_01: States "The card succeeds, so we need 0 discards to achieve 1 open" without showing step-by-step execution

• THOUGHT_02_02: States "Without discards: fails first (2<3), succeeds second (2≥1) = 1 open" but doesn't provide detailed trace like "At bulkhead 1: card power 2 vs threshold 3 → fails, move to bulkhead 2 with same card..."

• THOUGHT_02_03: States "Without discards: card 1 fails first, card 2 fails second, card 6 succeeds third = 1 open" but should have shown detailed steps like:
  - Step 1: At bulkhead 1 (threshold 5), front card is 1 (power 1). Compare: 1 < 5, fails. Move to bulkhead 2, card stays at position 0.
  - Step 2: At bulkhead 2 (threshold 3), front card is still 1 (power 1). Compare: 1 < 3, fails. Move to bulkhead 3, card stays at position 0.

• THOUGHT_02_04 through THOUGHT_02_10: All follow same pattern - propose test cases and state expected results but never walk through execution in detail

• CHAIN_02 only suggests test cases and states their expected outcomes

• CHAIN_02 does NOT provide step-by-step execution traces

• CHAIN_02 does NOT show detailed walkthroughs of how the algorithm processes each test case

• CHAIN_02 does NOT demonstrate the actual mechanics of the algorithm on specific inputs

• Entire chain is about designing test cases rather than analyzing them with detailed execution
