🔄 Running 1. Unique Solution Validation
⏱️ Completed in 37.2 seconds (0.62 minutes)

Result: ✅ PASS

🔄 Running 2. Time Complexity Authenticity Check
⏱️ Completed in 41.7 seconds (0.70 minutes)
----------------------------------------
Result: ❌ FAIL
🧹 Cleaning up failure details...

Issues Found:
• Sequential Format violation: The metadata lists complexities as comma-separated values "$O(2^{n^2})$, $O(2^{n^2})$, $O(n^2 k)$" but does NOT use arrow notation (-> or →) to show progression from inefficient to efficient approaches

• Required fix: The metadata should be "$O(2^{n^2})$ -> $O(2^{n^2})$ -> $O(n^2 k)$" or "$O(2^{n^2})$ → $O(2^{n^2})$ → $O(n^2 k)$"

🔄 Running 3. Style Guide Compliance
⏱️ Completed in 1.28 minutes (76.7 seconds)
----------------------------------------
Result: ❌ FAIL
🧹 Cleaning up failure details...

Issues Found:
• Line 5: `static const int MOD = 1000000007;` - Constants should use kCamelCase, should be: `kMod`

• Line 12: `static inline int mod_sub(int a, int b)` - Functions should use lowerCamelCase, should be: `modSub`

• Line 28: `int max_exp = n * n + 5;` - Variables should use lowerCamelCase, not snake_case, should be: `maxExp`

• Line 30: `std::vector<int> pow_base(max_exp + 1, 1);` - Variables should use lowerCamelCase, should be: `powBase`

• Line 40: `int s_max = std::min(k, m);` - Variables should use lowerCamelCase, should be: `sMax`

• Lines 44-45: `int e1 = t  (m - t + 1);` and `int e2 = t  (m - t);` - `e1` and `e2` are vague abbreviations, should be more descriptive like `intervalCount` and `adjustedCount`

• Line 46: `int w = mod_sub(pow_base[e1], pow_base[e2]);` - Single letter variable `w` is vague, should be: `weight` or `weightFactor`

🔄 Running 4. Naming Conventions
⏱️ Completed in 49.0 seconds (0.82 minutes)
----------------------------------------
Result: ❌ FAIL
🧹 Cleaning up failure details...

Issues Found:
• Constant naming violation - Line with `static const int MOD = 1000000007;`
  - Current: `MOD`
  - Should be: `kMod` (kCamelCase for constants)

• Variable naming violation - `int max_exp = n * n + 5;`
  - Current: `max_exp` (snake_case)
  - Should be: `maxExp` (lowerCamelCase)

• Variable naming violation - `std::vector<int> pow_base(max_exp + 1, 1);`
  - Current: `pow_base` (snake_case)
  - Should be: `powBase` (lowerCamelCase)

• Variable naming violation - `int s_max = std::min(k, m);`
  - Current: `s_max` (snake_case)
  - Should be: `sMax` (lowerCamelCase)

• Function naming violation - `static inline int mod_sub(int a, int b)`
  - Current: `mod_sub` (snake_case)
  - Should be: `modSub` (lowerCamelCase)

How to fix:
- Replace `MOD` with `kMod` throughout the code
- Replace `max_exp` with `maxExp`
- Replace `pow_base` with `powBase`
- Replace `s_max` with `sMax`
- Replace `mod_sub` with `modSub`

📝 31. COMPREHENSIVE REASONING THOUGHTS REVIEW
--------------------------------------------------
Status: ❌ FAIL

Issues Found:
• THOUGHT_01_03: "Interval graphs admit efficient algorithms for maximum independent set, but enumerating all $S$ is infeasible" - violates criterion 1(d) by mentioning efficient/inefficient approaches in Chain 1 before analysis

• THOUGHT_01_04: "This suggests generating-function-like reasoning or dynamic programming that respects how intervals combine" - violates criterion 1(d) by prematurely mentioning specific approaches (dynamic programming, generating functions) in Chain 1 without prior analysis

• THOUGHT_01_04: "many optimal substructures are exposed by the earliest finishing interval" - violates criterion 1(c) by making predictive statement about optimal substructures without prior analysis

FINAL VERDICT: FAIL
