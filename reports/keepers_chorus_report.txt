Result: ❌ FAIL

Issues Found:
• THOUGHT_01_03: "It is natural to distinguish Core intervals (those covering $C$) from Outer intervals (those not covering $C$)." - Violates criterion 1.d as Chain 1 should not contain information about approaches or data structures for solving the problem. The distinction between Core and Outer intervals is a key algorithmic approach that forms the basis of the solution strategy, which should not appear in Chain 1 (which is meant for clarifying objectives and constraints only).

📝 31. COMPREHENSIVE REASONING THOUGHTS REVIEW
--------------------------------------------------
Status: ❌ FAIL

Issues Found:
• THOUGHT_01_03: "It is natural to distinguish Core intervals (those covering $C$) from Outer intervals (those not covering $C$)." - Violates criterion 1.d as Chain 1 should not contain information about approaches or data structures for solving the problem. The distinction between Core and Outer intervals is a key algorithmic approach that forms the basis of the solution strategy, which should not appear in Chain 1 (which is meant for clarifying objectives and constraints only).
