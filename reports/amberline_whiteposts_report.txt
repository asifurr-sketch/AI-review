🧹 Cleaning up failure details...

Issues Found:
• Function `main`: Lacks any doxygen-style documentation. Missing function description and missing `@return` documentation.

• CRITICAL VIOLATION - UNDOCUMENTED: The main function is completely undocumented. This function should have documentation describing its purpose (reading input and computing loudness for each whistlepost) and return value documentation.

• C++ documentation requirements state that doxygen-style comments must be used for "all functions", which includes the main function.

⏱️ Completed in 49.4 seconds (0.82 minutes)
----------------------------------------
Result: ❌ FAIL
🧹 Cleaning up failure details...

Issues Found:
• Response lacks adequate example walkthrough with optimal algorithm as required

• Section 4 walkthrough is severely inadequate:
  - Only shows calculation for i=0, not the full example
  - Doesn't show binary search process, prefix sum calculations, or intermediate steps
  - Uses made-up example instead of provided examples
  - Claims "This matches the sample output" but uses non-sample data

• Walkthrough quote: "For i = 0 at p_0 = 0: west has no elements. East uses upper_bound with 0 + 3 = 3, so no in-cap east indices. Out-of-cap east are all posts and each contributes 3, total 3 × 3 = 9. This matches the sample output."

• Missing required walkthrough elements:
  - Building prefix sum array demonstration
  - Binary search process for each index
  - In-cap and out-of-cap count calculations
  - Prefix sum calculations step-by-step
  - Final total computation verification
  - Using actual provided examples instead of made-up data

Result: ❌ FAIL

Issues Found:
• CHAIN_02, THOUGHT_02_03: "Test asymmetric extremes: Mix L_i = 0 with large R_i and vice versa across posts" - This is a suggestion, not an actual execution.

• CHAIN_02, THOUGHT_02_04: "Test non-uniform spacing: Positions like p = [-4, 0, 3, 10, 13]" - Provides example inputs but no execution or analysis.

• CHAIN_02, THOUGHT_02_05: "Test boundary equalities: Construct cases where p_i - p_j = L_i" - Suggestion for test construction, no execution.

• CHAIN_02, THOUGHT_02_06: "Test scalability and overflow control: Large n (e.g., n = 200000)" - Testing recommendation without execution.

• CHAIN_02, THOUGHT_02_07: "Test randomness and cross-validation: For small n (e.g., n ≤ 2000)" - Validation strategy suggestion, no actual execution.

• CHAIN_02, THOUGHT_02_08: "Test minimality and zeros: n = 2, with various combinations of zero and nonzero caps" - Provides a specific case (p = [-3, 4], L = [0, 0], R = [5, 7]) but doesn't execute it or show calculations.

• CHAIN_02, THOUGHT_02_09: "Test uniform large caps that dominate all distances" - Describes expected behavior but provides no step-by-step execution.

• CHAIN_02, THOUGHT_02_01: "In the first example with three posts at −1e9, 0, and 1e9, all damping limits are 1e9. Any distance beyond that is clipped, so every interaction contributes exactly 1e9. Each post collects two such contributions, giving totals of 2e9 for all three." - Provides high-level explanation but no step-by-step walkthrough of calculations.

• CHAIN_02, THOUGHT_02_02: "In the second example with seven posts, the limits vary per post. For instance, post 3 (position 4) gathers 6 from the left and 34 from the right, giving 40; post 6 (position 17) is capped heavily to the left (all 1's) and clipped on the right (20), giving 25." - States results (6 from left, 34 from right) but doesn't show the detailed calculations of how these numbers were derived.

• CHAIN_02 titled "Designing thorough tests and Example analysis" contains primarily test design suggestions rather than actual test executions with step-by-step analysis.
