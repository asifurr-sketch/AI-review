static const int kModulus = 998244353;
```

• Add documentation for `main`:
```cpp

----------------------------------------
Result: ❌ FAIL
🧹 Cleaning up failure details...

Issues Found:
**FINAL VERDICT: FAIL**

• Missing relevant subtopic: "Computational Complexity Theory" should have been included in the selected list

• The solution requires significant computational complexity analysis beyond basic Big O notation:
  - Analyzing computational feasibility of different approaches
  - Comparing time complexities across multiple algorithms  
  - Making algorithmic decisions based on complexity bounds
  - Understanding theoretical limits of computational tractability

• Current subtopics insufficient for covering the deeper complexity theory considerations needed for algorithm selection and optimization strategies

🔄 Running: 25. No Predictive Headings in Thoughts
⏱️ Completed in 0.90 minutes
----------------------------------------
Result: ❌ FAIL
🧹 Cleaning up failure details...

Issues Found:
• **THOUGHT_04_01**: Reveals hash table/frequency approach in heading before analyzing it
  - Violation: "A natural refinement is to precompute h[t], the frequency of each value t in E. Then iterate over all pairs (i, j), compute t = S_i ⊕ F_j, and add h[t] to the answer."
  - Fix: Use non-predictive heading like "Exploring optimization approaches"

• **THOUGHT_05_01**: Reveals XOR-convolution approach and solution method in heading before exploring it
  - Violation: "We move from indices to values via frequency arrays. Let f[v] and g[v] be the frequencies of v in S and F. The number of pairs yielding each t is the XOR-convolution..."
  - Fix: Use heading like "Analyzing frequency-based methods"

• **THOUGHT_06_01**: Reveals FWHT solution and key property before analyzing it
  - Violation: "The FWHT is a specialized transform for XOR-convolutions. For the unnormalized XOR transform T, we have T(f ⊛_X g) = T(f) ⊙ T(g)..."
  - Fix: Use heading like "Investigating transform-based approaches"

• **THOUGHT_06_02**: Reveals key implementation insight and formula before deriving it
  - Violation: "We can compute the desired sum without explicitly forming (f ⊛_X g). The Hadamard inner-product identity gives..."
  - Fix: Use heading like "Examining computational optimizations"

• **THOUGHT_06_03**: Reveals entire algorithm steps in heading before explaining them
  - Violation: "Algorithm outline: Let M be the maximum value... Choose N as the smallest power of two... Build arrays f, g, h... Apply the in-place unnormalized FWHT..."
  - Fix: Use heading like "Developing implementation strategy"

🔄 Running: 26. Comprehensive Reasoning Thoughts Review
⏱️ Completed in 2.03 minutes
----------------------------------------
Result: ❌ FAIL

Issues Found:
Looking at this reasoning chain document with maximum attention to detail, I will systematically analyze each thought against the specified criteria.

## Issues Found:

• **[THOUGHT_01_05]**:
  - "Because of the large values of p, q, and r, enumerating all possible (i, j, k) combinations would involve an extremely large number of operations (up to 4 × 10^10), which exceeds practical computational limits" - This provides information about an approach being inefficient in solving the problem, violating criterion 1d which states Chain 1 should not contain such information.

• **[THOUGHT_02_04]**:
  - "compare the optimized result with a naive triple-loop computation" - This mentions different approaches (optimized vs naive) for solving the problem, violating criterion 1d which states Chain 2 should not contain information about approaches that are efficient or inefficient.

• **[THOUGHT_02_05]**:
  - "correct choice of transform length N" - This references an advanced data structure/approach (transforms) that hasn't been introduced yet in Chain 2, violating criterion 1d.

• **[THOUGHT_02_06]**:
  - "Ensures that the approach handles very uneven input sizes efficiently" - This discusses efficiency of an approach, violating criterion 1d for Chain 2.

• **[THOUGHT_02_07]**:
  - "If the maximum value M equals 2^k, confirm that N is chosen as 2^(k+1). This prevents aliasing and guarantees that all indices 0 … M are representable within the transform length" - This discusses specific implementation details of a transform-based approach that hasn't been introduced yet in Chain 2, violating criterion 1d.

**FINAL VERDICT: FAIL**
