🧹 Cleaning up failure details...

Issues Found:
**FAILURE ANALYSIS:**

• **Missing Essential Subtopic**: "Trees and Tries" is NOT selected but is required
  - Segment Trees are fundamental to the solution but "Segment Trees" is not in the provided taxonomy list
  - "Trees and Tries" is the appropriate taxonomy category that covers segment trees
  - Segment trees are used throughout chains 5-9 for:
    - Building over compressed y-coordinates
    - Maintaining coverage count and covered length
    - Handling range add/remove operations
    - Entire feasibility check depends on it

• **Potential Missing Subtopic**: "Computational Complexity Theory" not selected
  - Solution involves proving monotonicity properties of F(L) over powers of two
  - Establishing feasibility predicates beyond just Big O analysis

🔄 Running: 25. No Predictive Headings in Thoughts
⏱️ Completed in 0.84 minutes

Result: ❌ FAIL
🧹 Cleaning up failure details...

Issues Found:
## Failures Found

• **THOUGHT_04_05**: Violates non-predictive requirement by explicitly stating the solution approach:
  > "To achieve O(log S) per update, we need a structure that supports range adds and directly tracks the union length of covered y-segments. **A segment tree over compressed y with a cover count and covered-length at each node provides exactly this capability.**"
  - Reveals the segment tree solution before analysis is complete

• **THOUGHT_05_05**: Violates non-predictive requirement by revealing the solution:
  > "To avoid this, we require a range-update data structure that returns the total covered y-length in O(1) (from the root) after an O(log S) update. **A segment tree over compressed breakpoints with a cover counter implements this efficiently.**"
  - Explicitly states the segment tree solution before proper analysis leads to that conclusion

**Both thoughts should explore problems and requirements without jumping to announce the specific data structure solution.**

🔄 Running: 27. Thought Heading Violations Check
⏱️ Completed in 0.89 minutes
----------------------------------------
Result: ❌ FAIL

Issues Found:
Looking through all THOUGHT_XX_YY sections systematically:

**Violations found:**

• **[THOUGHT_02_01]**: "Single small rectangle near the origin"

• **[THOUGHT_02_02]**: "Two disjoint small rectangles far apart"  

• **[THOUGHT_02_03]**: "Two disjoint $3\times 3$ blocks with a gap multiple of $L$"

• **[THOUGHT_02_04]**: "Aligned and boundary-touching rectangles"

• **[THOUGHT_02_05]**: "Overlapping and nested rectangles"

• **[THOUGHT_02_06]**: "Extremely large coordinates and dimensions"

• **[THOUGHT_02_07]**: "Stress on $K$ edge cases**"

• **[THOUGHT_02_08]**: "$M$ not a power of two"

• **[THOUGHT_06_03]**: "During the sweep:"

• **[THOUGHT_08_01]**: "Half-open to inclusive conversion is crucial."

• **[THOUGHT_09_05]**: "Functional components include:"

These sections contain heading-like text that describes or titles what follows, rather than directly providing analysis content. The THOUGHT_02_XX sections in particular use descriptive labels for test cases, THOUGHT_06_03 and THOUGHT_09_05 use colon-followed descriptions that introduce lists, and THOUGHT_08_01 starts with what appears to be a topic statement acting as a heading.

FINAL VERDICT: FAIL

----------------------------------------

🔄 Running: 28. Comprehensive Reasoning Thoughts Review
⏱️ Completed in 0.94 minutes
----------------------------------------
Result: ❌ FAIL

Issues Found:
Looking at the reasoning chains with maximum attention to detail, I'll analyze each thought against all specified criteria.

**[THOUGHT_01_05]**:
- "the function $F(L)$—the number of intersected cells—is non-increasing as $L$ increases along the sequence $\{1,2,4,\dots\}$" - This states a non-trivial algorithmic property about efficiency/behavior without prior analysis. This violates criterion 1d which specifies that Chain 1 should not contain information about approaches that are efficient or inefficient in solving the problem.

All other thoughts follow proper manuscript style with analysis preceding conclusions, provide accurate and sufficient information, avoid redundancy, and properly derive insights through analysis before stating them.
