🧹 Cleaning up failure details...

Issues Found:
• CONSTANT NAMING VIOLATION
  - Location: Line after includes section
  - Violating Code: `static const int MODULUS = 1000000007;`
  - Issue: Constants should use kCamelCase format
  - Fix: Should be `static const int kModulus = 1000000007;`

• PRIVATE MEMBER VARIABLE NAMING VIOLATIONS
  - Location: FenwickMaxCount class, private section
  - Violating Code: 
    ```cpp
    private:
        int numRanks_;
        std::vector<DpState> tree_;
    ```
  - Issue: Variables should use lowerCamelCase. The trailing underscore violates this convention

  - Violation: "Ranks: $brightness[1]=1 \rightarrow rank=2$, $brightness[2]=2 \rightarrow rank=3$"
  - Should be: "Ranks: $brightness[1]=1 \rightarrow rank=2$, $brightness[2]=2 \rightarrow rank=3$"
  - Issue: "rank=2" and "rank=3" are mathematical assignments/equations showing mapping results and should be enclosed in LaTeX format as "$rank=2$" and "$rank=3$"

Status: ❌ FAIL

Issues Found:
• CHAIN_03 - THOUGHT_03_02: Duplicate thought numbers - two thoughts labeled as THOUGHT_03_02, first discussing "A slightly better approach would fix each possible pivot position..." and second discussing "A slightly less naive strategy is to fix a pivot $i$..."

• CHAIN_04 - THOUGHT_04_03: Duplicate thought numbers - two identical THOUGHT_04_03 entries containing "Corner cases to handle: when $r = m$, skip the decrement at $r + 1$..."

• CHAIN_01: Missing information about efficient/inefficient approaches (required for Chain 1)

• CHAIN_02: Missing information about efficient/inefficient approaches (required for Chain 2)
