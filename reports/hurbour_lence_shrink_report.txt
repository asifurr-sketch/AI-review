🧹 Cleaning up failure details...

Issues Found:
• "Illustrative example" section under "4. Code Explanation" - For k=2 (2 lanes): Claims "Second lane: Boats 3 and 4: Length = 2 + 2 + 9 + 2 = 13" but actual calculation should be 2 + 9 + 2 = 13, not 2 + 2 + 9 + 2

• "Illustrative example" section - For k=2 (2 lanes): States "minimum required length for 2 lanes: R(2) = 24" without justification - this value doesn't follow from the previous calculations

• "Illustrative example" section - For k=3 (3 lanes): Claims arrangement "First lane: Boats 1 and 2 (length 13), Second lane: Boat 3 (length 2), Third lane: Boat 4 (length 2)" - this is impossible as there are 5 boats, not 4

• "Illustrative example" section - For k=3 (3 lanes): If boat 5 were placed with boat 4, that lane would need 2 + 9 + 2 = 13, not 2

• "Illustrative example" section - For k=4 (4 lanes): The arrangement description is incoherent - claims "First lane: 2, 2 (Boats 1 and 2): Length = 13" then says remaining boats 3, 4, 5 each take one lane, but that would be 4 total lanes with inconsistent boat distribution

• "Illustrative example" section - Conceptual confusion: The execution example appears to be solving a different problem (given k lanes, find minimum L) rather than the actual algorithm (given L, find minimum lanes H(L), then optimize L×H(L))

Issues Found:
• Section 4 (Code Explanation) - Variable reference error: Response states "It builds lanes left-to-right, appending boat i if `cur + gaps[i-1] + boatLengths[i] <= laneLength`" but variable `cur` does not exist in the provided code. The actual variable used is `currentLength`.

🔄 Running 12. Time and Space Complexity Correctness
⏱️ Completed in 1.16 minutes (69.5 seconds)
----------------------------------------
Result: ❌ FAIL
🧹 Cleaning up failure details...

Issues Found:
• Time complexity incorrectly stated as "roughly O(n·S) where S is the number of evaluated L's" and claims S is "typically O(n) in practice"

• Actual worst-case time complexity is O(n log W), not the claimed typical case analysis

• Document conflates "typical" behavior with worst-case complexity guarantees

• Space complexity stated as "O(n) for inputs plus O(S) for the cache" but S is not properly bounded in worst-case terms

• Cache size S could be O(log W) to much larger in pathological cases, potentially exceeding 8MB memory limit

• Analysis mixes empirical observations ("typically", "in practice", "empirically fast") with formal complexity analysis instead of providing rigorous worst-case bounds

• Fails to distinguish between average-case and worst-case scenarios in complexity statements

• W can reach up to 80 million (4000n where n ≤ 20,000), making cache memory usage potentially problematic

🧹 Cleaning up failure details...

Issues Found:
• Field Order violation: Document contains extra field "GitHub URL" between Category and Topic that is NOT in the required field list

• Required order broken: The requirements explicitly state "All fields must be present in this exact order" and list 7 specific fields. The GitHub URL field breaks this required order.

  - Category

Result: ❌ FAIL
🧹 Cleaning up failure details...

Issues Found:
• Error 1: Incorrect k=3 Analysis - Document states "First lane: Boats 1 and 2: Length = 2 + 2 + 9 = 13" and "Second lane: Boat 3: Length = 2" and "Third lane: Boat 4: Length = 2" - This only accounts for 4 boats when there are 5 boats in the input, arrangement is incomplete

• Error 2: Confused k=4 Analysis - Document states "First lane: 2, 2 (Boats 1 and 2): Length = 2 + 2 + 9 = 13" and "Remaining boats 3, 4, 5 take one boat each with their own lane" - This describes 4 lanes total but incorrectly states R(4) = 13, which doesn't align with the described arrangement

• Error 3: Incorrect k=2 Calculation - Document claims R(2) = 24 and footprint = 48, but doesn't properly show how boats would be distributed across 2 lanes to achieve a maximum lane length of 24

• Mathematical and logical errors in intermediate steps and calculations in the walkthrough that would mislead readers trying to understand the algorithm
